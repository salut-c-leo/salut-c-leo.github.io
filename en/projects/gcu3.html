              <h2>Details</h2>
                <p>Gear.Club Unlimited 3's Lead Level Designer gave me the opportunity to create <b>5 tracks and 7 races</b> on a Mediterreanean terrain of my choice. This internship lasted the whole duration of the game's production.</p>

              <h3>What I brought to the project</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>A fresh look: my narrative and visual approach combined with my expertise in other game genres empowered me to propose and affirm a distinct identity to my tracks</li>
                  <li>Documentation and quality control to ensure a visual and gameplay coherence between the numerous tracks</li>
                  <li>User feedback on tools used in production</li>
                  <li><s>A reference to Undertale</s></li>
                </ul>
              <h3>Level Design</h3>
                <p>Based on the surroundings of a village near Perpignan, the zone I'll be working on is imported in Unity. Its Terrain tool enables me to remodel the map in any way I need, taking into account the project's artistic direction, gameplay requirements and my Lead's feedback.</p>
                <p>To determine where to create my tracks, I look at the list of landmarks available in the project to find which ones I could use and how to make them shine. I make room for a fortress built on top of a hill, a road following along a canal, a mountain host to a research lab... while still trying to follow the natural shape of the terrain. The goal being of having 5 tracks on the terrain, I build a privitive version of each in the engine, with close attention paid to the visibility of each track and landmark. Once the first draft of a track is done, my Lead suggests improvements which become more and more minute as time goes on.</p>
                <p>Gear.Club Unlimited 3's tracks aren't created in a vacuum. They're tailored to the Game Designers' specifications and to the "simcade" genre. Each track was made with the cars currently available when you're playing in Career mode in mind, roadsides sizes were ajusted to enable game mechanics to shine.</p>
                <p>Tool Programmers shipped several tools during production, whether to enable decorations following the road using splines, a better enemy AI handling by laying down braking points, etc. With the other level designers, I made some feedback to improve the tools' user experience, which will serve in future productions.</p>
              <h3>Documentation</h3>
                <p>I wrote my visual intentions for Level Artists so they could do an art pass on my tracks. Directives were clear, while letting artists improvise if they wanted to. For the Level Design division, I also wrote documentation standardizing road types (roadsides, angles, width...), to guarantee a visual and gameplay coherence between the dozens of tracks the game contains.</p>
