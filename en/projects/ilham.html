              <h1>Project breakdown</h1>
              <p>The game was pitched by Roman Grzegorzewski, the other Game Designer of this project. We wanted to make an arena fighting game talking more literally about depression and how the protagonist would follow a cognitive behavioral therapy, with a snappy controller, very physical feedbacks and enjoyable to play with. This version was abandoned a month later, after the jury of the first project defense asked us to rework the whole pitch.</p>

              <p>It took a month (mid-November / mid-December) to conceptualize a new game. A day-long meeting was needed to define what would be the intentions before creating or recycling existing gameplay mechanics.</p>

              <p><b>I was in charge of Level Design and part of the Narrative Design</b> on this project. Game mechanics were mostly conceptualized by Roman, with some suggestions and tweaks on my part.</p>

              <h3>Level Design</h3>
                <p>The <b>first layout drafts</b> were made during prepoduction of the chapter, <b>in Photoshop</b>.</p>
                <img loading="lazy" src="../../projets/img/ilham_layout.png">
                <p><b>As time was short</b>, I chose <b>quick iterations</b> over documenting my layout well, explaining why a lot of details are missing. I clearly lack in drawing skills, so this mockup is used more as a way to keep track of my intentions and explaining my intentions in-person to Roman and programmers, so they can greenlight my proposals.</p>
                <p><b>Unreal's Modeling Mode</b> alongside the <a href="https://marynate.itch.io/mesh-tool" target="_blank">Mesh Tool</a> plugin enabled me to quickly iterate on my blockout.</p>

                <p><b>My main goal with this level</b> was to introduce mechanics in a fluid way, without tutorials. To do so, each mechanic would be introduced in an isolated <em>beat</em> with safety measures (walls, stairs to come back up...), until I considered the mechanic understood enough (3 to 4 segments per beat) to get rid of the safety measures and let players master the controller.</p>
                <p>Although it is not the game's intention, it is possible to speedrun the level or even encourage it. The workflow we had with the 3D Artist enabled us to rapidly add new meshes to accomodate potential shortcuts, while generously large trigger boxes activating wind across the map can let the player skip part of the level and reach the end faster.</p>
