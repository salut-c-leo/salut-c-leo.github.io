              <p>Map Labs is a mapping community for Half-Life 2, making maps according to a theme in a short timespan, usually two weeks to a month. Each map competition is judged by Source modding veterans. Two of my maps ended up in 3rd place.</p>

              <p>Each map competition is announced on Discord along its theme. I usually spend around an hour finding ideas for a level that I then write down on paper, along with a rough layout.</p>

              <p>Novoom Prospekt takes place in Half-Life 2's Nova Prospekt. Inspired by Doom Eternal's mechanics, you have to escape the prison through 3 enemy waves. One of the things I would rework would be the red filter applied during combat which cause eye strain the longer the combat goes on. The level design has rough edges too, as I tried to restrict myself to what was in Half-Life 2 to make the journey familiar, and I would definitely rework the whole layout to make combat more enjoyable. It is still a challenging map and a twist on Nova Prospekt, and I'm glad it ended up 3rd out of 7 maps.</p>
              <p>Everything is Out of Time is cut in two segments: first at home, in an abstract place where you put objects in their right place, and a segment at work, where you decide to spend time on a dating app rather than do your job. The competition's theme asked to make a level inspired by two songs, which here are Radiohead's <em>Everything in its Right Place</em> and Blur's <em>Out of Time</em>. The level ended up 3rd out of 9 maps.</em></p>
